LoRa (Moisture) Sensor Data to AWS IoT
This Arduino sketch enables the monitoring of soil moisture levels using a resistive moisture sensor and transmits this data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT Core using LoRa communication. The code consists of two main parts: one for sending data (LoRa++ Sender) and the other for receiving and displaying data (LoRa++ Receiver) with an OLED screen.
